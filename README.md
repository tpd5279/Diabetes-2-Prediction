# Diabetes prediction
Predicting Diabetes from diagnostic measurements

# Summary
Predicting diabetes using decision tree-based models was explored using a data set of female patients, aged 21 or older with an ethnicity of Pima Indian. The data set originated from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, was sourced from Kaggle , and included measures associated with diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes were noted in a binary variable called Outcome, where 1 indicated that the patient had diabetes. The data set did not provide the type of diabetes. Measures included the number of pregnancies, level of blood glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, level of blood insulin, body mass index (BMI), age, and a predictor indicating the probability that the patient may have diabetes based on family history (DiabetesPedigreeFunction).
